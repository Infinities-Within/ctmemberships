# Community Theater Memberships

This repository contains a web application intended to assist community theaters (and other non-profit organizations) in collecting and managing memberships.

# Feature Plan

- Serverless, running in Amazon AWS
- Simple to deploy and maintain
- Integrations with PayPal and Stripe
- No licensing costs!

# Goals

I have been running the ticketing and reservation system for [Murfreesboro Little Theatre](https://www.mltarts.com) for several years now, and have been very disappointed in the lack of low- or no-cost solutions for non-profits to provide membership and ticketing systems. Time to change that!

This project aims to provide an easy to use and configure membership management system that integrates with the most popular online payment systems. It will be low-cost, using Amazon Web Services to host the site, and released for free under the GNU Affero General Public License. I've chosen to use a strong copy-left license in order to encourage any other technically-minded individuals to contribute back to the project with new features and help enrich community theaters and the performing arts in general worldwide.
